**Fireman vs Fire vs Snowman**
Entry for Ludum Dare compo #31

##Theme
Entire Game On One Screen

##Overview
Not a fan of the theme. I reject the mechanical interpretation, and instead tack on a few words to arrive at a different and more maleable theme: "Entire game on screen AT ONE TIME." The game will have multiple screens each mirroring the other with slight differences, but only one of the screens is active. Switch to a different screen when the going gets tough, but know that each screen has different entities and different dangers.

###Description
Have you wondered who would win in a fight of firemen vs fire vs snowmen? I that why you mind controlling them and forcing them to attack each other? You're kind of a jerk. Also, because you're a really big jerk you're mind controlling one of each at any given time. But justice will be served, because I saw the Matrix and apparently when you die in the mind of something else you die in real life and the blue pill and also reasons.

###KNOWN ISSUES: 
- Special effects and animations are absent. It's almost as if I ran out of time.
- It ramps up hard pretty quicker than I'd like
- Sound doesn't seem to preload properly.
