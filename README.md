#LD31

Base code for Ludum Dare compo #31.  

##Theme
Entire Game On One Screen

##Overview
Not a fan of the theme. I reject the mechanical interpretation, and instead tack on a few words to arrive at a different and more maleable theme: "Entire game on screen AT ONE TIME." The game will have multiple screens each mirroring the other with slight differences, but only one of the screens is active. Switch to a different screen when the going gets tough, but know that each screen has different entities and different dangers.

###Known Issues, TO-DO List, Reminders

* New art with an actual theme
* Game Title
* HUD UI
* Sound effects
* Music
* Special effects
* Additional gameplay tweaking - e.g., Waves 

Well at least it's playable. :)
